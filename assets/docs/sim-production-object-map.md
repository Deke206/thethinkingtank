# ShyneTyme SIM production object map

## Production routes

```text
build-my-bike.html  -> LED Bike SIM
build-my-home.html  -> LED Home SIM
build-my-auto.html  -> LED Auto SIM
```

## Shared presentation files

```text
assets/css/site-navigation.css
  BEGIN: Shared simulator stylesheet loader
  END:   Shared simulator stylesheet loader

assets/css/sim-controls-shared.css
  BEGIN: Shared ShyneTyme simulator design tokens
  END:   Shared simulator form controls
```

The shared simulator stylesheet is imported by the canonical navigation
stylesheet, so Bike, Home, and Auto receive the same control skin without
replacing their existing simulator event logic.
